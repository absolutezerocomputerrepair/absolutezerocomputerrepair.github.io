	<p>I do not offer repair services at clients' homes. By bringing your computer into my shop, you only pay for the time I work on your machine, rather than paying me to sit in your home while I wait for the computer to finish its tasks.</p>

	<h2 id="recycle">Computer Recycling</h2>
	
	<p>While most recycling centers take in all electronic equipment for recycling, those services are usually meant for end of life electronics. Sadly most recycled electronics often still have a lot of life left in them, or perhaps certain components still have life in a defective item. My shop takes in broken or unwanted computer equipment (accepted types listed below) with the aim of reusing as much equipment as possible, while truly end of life components are then recycled at traditional responsible recyclers.</p>
	
	<p>Help our planet and lessen your carbon footprint by recycling your electronics with me so that as much can be reused as possible.</p>
	
	<p><u>Accepted Reusable/Recyclable Items:</u></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Desktop Computers</li>
		<li>Laptops</li>
		<li>Tablets</li>
		<li>Computer Monitors</li>
		<li>Game Consoles</li>
		<li>Cell Phones</li>
		<li>iPods</li>
		<li>Cables</li>
		<li>Printers/Large Format Printers/Plotters</li>
		<li>3D Printers</li>
		<li>Servers</li>
		<li>Networking Equipment</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Have an item to recycle that's not on this list? Contact me to see if I accept it!</p>
	
	<p>Many have recycled their broken/unwanted electronics with me over the years in my previous organization called <b>Computers for Kids</b>, which ran from 2012-2024, helping youth, families, and senior citizens in need have access to information technology equipment.
	<br>Know that your used equipment is in good hands, and will be reused/recycled in ways that help the environment, our community, and hopefully provide affordable computing alternatives for many people.</p>
